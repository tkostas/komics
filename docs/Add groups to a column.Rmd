You have you dataset in a long format (measurements and samples are in a column) and you want to add column names for each sample based on a reference table containing samples and groups information. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# e.g. define a vector with the sample names. You can extract it directly using names(my_data)
sample_names <- c("A01", "A02", "A03",
                  "B01", "B02", "B03", 
                  "C01", "C02", "C03")


# Define a second vector with the group names, keeping the same order with above
group_names <- c("A", "A", "A",
                 "B", "B", "B", 
                 "C", "C", "C")

# Merge both vectors in one dataframe
groups_df <- data.frame(samples = sample_names, groups = group_names)


# add groups and save the output in a new dataframe
grouped_data <- add_groups_col(x = my_data_long, 
                               samples_vector = groups_df$samples, 
                               groups_vector = groups_df$groups, 
                               samples_column = "Samples_column", 
                               column_name = "Groups_column_name")
```
