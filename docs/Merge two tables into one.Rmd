In cases where you need to add additional columns to your working dataframe (e.g. annotation columns), you can use the `append_cols_df()` function. Type `?append_cols_df()` to see more info about the functions arguments. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# e.g. 
d4 <- append_cols_df(x = d3,
                     y = annotation_df,
                     key_x = "gene_id",
                     key_y = "Gene ID ", 
                     append_y = names(annotation_df[2:length(annotation_df)]))

```
